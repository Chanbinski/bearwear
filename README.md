# Bearwear
Bearwear is a digital closet web application, where users can signup/signin and easily manage their clothing items online. It is made for one of Codeology Spring 22 projects as an introduction to full stack development. We used React, Firebase, and TailwindCSS.

For the first two weeks, we learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a basic website, and created a simpler version of bearwear. For the next two weeks, we learned React and converted our app so far using different features in React. In the following weeks, we learned Firebase, specifically Firebase Authentication for user signup/signin, and Firebase Storage for storing user clothing images. Finally, we deployed our apps using vercel.
